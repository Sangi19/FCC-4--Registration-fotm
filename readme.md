<h1 align="center"> FCC-4-Registration Form </h1>

## Getting Started:
- It is a HTML project for exploring the deep basic understanding of HTML elements that are useful for the registration form.

## Tech stack:
- browser
- Code Editor (like Visual Studio Code/ notepad)

## Things Learnt:
    - As label elements are inline by default, to make them block, 
        - To make them appear on separate lines : display: block
        - to separate them from each other : margin:0.5rem 0
    - To handle the form submission, add an input element with the type attribute set to submit and the value attribute set to Submit.
    - regex- With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression.
    - for input element with the 'number' type, we can set min and max to control the values.
    -  To give textarea an initial size, we can add the rows and cols attributes.
    - With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable element with a name attribute.
    - With a display of block the element sits flush against the left edge of its parent. To center this element
        - input[type="submit"] {
            display: block;
            width: 60vw;
            margin: 0 auto;
        }
    - To change the margin property we can include value(1em) on the top and bottom, while leaving the right and left margins set to auto or any other value.
